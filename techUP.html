                     YEP (Youth Empowerement Platform) organized a project that would influence students to continue studying computer science. The TechUP project is a FREE computer programming class, open to Gostivar high school students. The project coordinator is Alexander Pachman. The mentors for this term are Arlind Musliu and Angele Jovanoski. The students manage to create their own websites after successfully completing the tasks presented during the TechUp program. The class is designed for beginners and teaches you to design a website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Classes are held in the Municipality building on Saturdays from 12-2PM between October 15th and December 3rd. Materials are taught in Albanian, Macedonian and English. Students had a look at the most updated and common tools used for creating a good looking website. </p>

                <img src="./img/3.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;" >
                <p style="padding: 10px;"><br>As part of the program, the students had the chance to modify two simple games that were developed with the Python programming language. This was useful to understand that computer science has much more opportunities than simply creating a website.

                    Students chose a particular topic on which they developed their website idea. They had to use an online tool for creating the logo that fits their topic. Background images, contact forms and a gallery of images were part of their websites. Until the end of the program, each student managed to created a fully functional website that satisfies the needs of a regular user.</p>

                <p style="padding: 10px;"><br>The students did not learn how to adapt their website to fit devices with smaller screens, like smartphones. However, the plan is to continue their development with another course that will teach them some more advanced features.

                    Each week, the students could go to the official website and download the codes that were developed by their mentors. These codes helped them stay on track and keep their websites free of mistakes. The guidelines were very helpful because the users were often complicating their code. The presentation slides were available online each week as well.</pstyle="padding: 10px;">
